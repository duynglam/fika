# eff why I
customized starbies orders & homemade DIY.
espressoly crafted for fika. 
in coffee, we trust. 

most of the drinks are coffee and matcha. these twos are my fav. I'll come up with the tea choices soon.

don't mind the title. I came up with it

please check with the barista about the adds-on. they might give you a weird look. just stick with your choice
- adds on like choco/matcha powder usually comes free. I used to order a greentea latte with 5 extra scoops of matcha powder. The only thing I paid in extra is my dignity.
- but espresso and syrup shot doesn't. 15.000VND/ espresso shot and 10.000VND/ syrup pump as I remember. which is why I put this bullet under the `check with the baristas`

the list will be updated through times. stay tuned.
