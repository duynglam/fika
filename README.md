Customized order for starbucks, or anywhere.
- most of the drinks are coffee and matcha. these twos are my fav. I'll come up with the tea choices soon.
- don't mind the title. I came up with it
- please check with the barista about the adds-on
	- they might give you a weird look. just stick with your choice
	- adds on like choco/matcha powder usually comes free. I used to order a greentea latte with 5 extra scoops of matcha powder. The only thing I paid in extra is my dignity.
	- but espresso and syrup shot does. 15.000VND/ espresso shot and 10.000VND/ syrup pump as I remember

- the list will be updated through times. stay tuned.
