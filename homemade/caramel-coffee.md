- 1 cup black coffee (around 250-300ml), mircrowave until simmer hot
- 2-3 spoons of condensed milk -> mix in 
- 1 teaspoon Nestle Coffee Mate Vanilla Caramel powder
- iced

I got the coffee mate creamer powder on Shopee. tbh the whole idea was inspired by homemade.starbucks (surprised ?!). seeing those tiktok creators making their coffee in glass jar really hook me in lmao.
